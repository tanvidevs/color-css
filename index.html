    <h1 style="color:green; background-color: crimson;"><u>The Golden Touch.</u></h1>
    <p style="color: blue;">The Golden Touch is an ancient Greek myth about the greedy ruler of the ancient kingdom of Phrygia. Despite his massive fortune, King Midas does not recognise the value of true happiness. One night, he receives a divine guest who promises him the Golden Touch,<span style="background-color: pink;"> the power to turn anything he touches into gold. The following morning, he is overjoyed with his new powers, but he soon discovers that his wish is actually a curse.</span></p>
    <p style="color: blue; background-color: rgb(110, 169, 177);">Once upon a time, there lived a cloth merchant in a village with his wife and two children. They were indeed quite well-off. They had a beautiful hen which laid an egg every day. It was not an ordinary egg, rather, a golden egg. But the man was not satisfied with what he used to get daily. He was a get rich-trice kind of a person.

        The man wanted to get all the golden eggs from his hen at one single go. So, one day he thought hard and at last clicked upon a plan. He decided to kill the hen and get all the eggs together.</p>
